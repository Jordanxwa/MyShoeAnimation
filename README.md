In order to initiate your expo project you will go to your directory of
choice then proceed with the following:

1. expo i "name of folder"
2. click the first option for a blank start
3. name your project

From then you can either install an npm/yarn package or start your project
by typing "expo start" which will bring you to a page where you can scan a
QR code to view on your mobile device.

My Project in particular is about shoes is uses elements such as ScroolView
styling, and image imports.
